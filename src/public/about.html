    <h3>CMPT 315 Project Proposal: Open-Rank</h3>
    <p class="index-content-p">
        Tournaments, leagues and various competitions are extremely prevelant in modern day society.
        Planning for these types of events becomes a burden for small organizations who want a
        simple outlet for creating small tournaments, leagues and competitions. A system is
        needed to allow for small organizations to display up-to-date results, schedules,
        rankings, and statistics for members of that particular organization. The social aspect
        of competition must also be addressed to account for various types of communications
        throughout the system, such as being able to banter with others on results in a real-time
        fashion. Current systems lack this social aspect and only allow for the simple creation of
        tournament brackets.

        Based on the lack of social engagement for competitions, Open-Rank will create an
        environment that promotes communication among participants. It will also give small
        organizations an intuitive and dynamic system for creating and managing
        tournaments/leagues. During a tournament, administrators will be able to add in the
        results instantly which will in turn update visualization charts, leaderboards, and
        statistics.

        With simple tools, small organizations will remove the hassle of creating tournaments,
        leagues, and competitions. They will be able to use the Open-Rank system as an easy way
        to manage competitions on-the-fly. Participants of the organization will also have a place
        to communicate with each other while being able to view results, leaderboards, and
        statistics. These features will primarily be built using the following tools: mySQL,
        node.js, angularjs.

    <h3>Main Goal</h3>
    <p class="index-content-p">
        The main goal of this website will be to help small organizations and clubs organize and
        track the progress of its members through rankings and leaderboards. It will also allow
        them to create their own tournaments within the site. The Macewan Billiards club has
        expressed interest in using the sites services upon completion. For some time now, they
        have been looking into creating a ranking system so that their members can track their
        progress, however, the process is very time consuming. It would be more beneficial to
        outsource the ranking system instead of wasting valuable time creating it themselves.
        The end goal is for this website to be the norm for all up coming clubs/organizations
        to use our services to store and update their members data. We also hope that this
        can create opportunities for those members who rank well to be scouted by larger
        organizations.
