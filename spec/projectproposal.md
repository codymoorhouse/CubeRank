CMPT 315 Project Proposal: Open Rank
====================================
Tournaments, leagues and various competitions are extremely prevelant in
modern day society. Planning for these types of events becomes a burden for
small organizations who want a simple outlet for creating small tournaments,
leagues and competitions. A system is needed to allow for small organizations
to display up-to-date results, schedules, rankings, and statistics for members
of that particular organization. The social aspect of competition must also be
addressed to account for various types of communications throughout the
system, such as being able to banter with others on results in a real-time
fashion. Current systems lack this social aspect and only allow for the simple
creation of tournament brackets.

Based on the lack of social engagement for competitions, *Open-Rank* will
create an environment that promotes communication among participants. It will also
give small organizations an intuitive and dynamic system for creating and
managing tournaments/leagues. During a tournament, administrators will be able
to add in the results instantly which will in turn update visualization
charts, leaderboards, and statistics. 

With simple tools, small organizations will remove the hassle of creating
tournaments, leagues, and competitions. They will be able to use the
*Open-Rank* system as an easy way to manage competitions on-the-fly. 
Participants of the organization will also have a place to communicate 
with each other while being able to view results, leaderboards, and statistics.

The main goal of this website will be to help small organizations and clubs organize 
and track the progress of its members through rankings and leaderboards.  It will also
allow them to create their own tournaments within the site.  The Macewan Billiards club
has expressed interest in using the sites services upon completion.  For some time now,
they have been looking into creating a ranking system so that their members can track 
their progress, however, the process is very time consuming. It would be more beneficial 
to outsource the ranking system instead of wasting valuable time creating it themselves. 
The end goal is for this website to be the norm for all up coming clubs/organizations
to use our services to store and update their members data.  We also hope that this 
can create opportunities for those members who rank well to be scouted by larger 
organizations.
