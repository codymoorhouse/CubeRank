CMPT 315 Project Proposal: Open Rank
====================================
Tournaments, leagues and various competitions are taking place everyday in
modern day society. Planning for these types of events becomes a burden for
small organizations who want a simple outlet for creating small tournaments,
leagues and competitions. A system is needed to allow for small organizations
to display up-to-date results, schedules, rankings, and statistics for members
of that particular organization. The social aspect of competition must also be
addressed to include for various types of communications throughout the
system, such as being able to banter with others on results in a real-time
fashion. Current systems lack this social aspect and only allow for the simple
creation of tournament brackets.


Open Rank will fill in this void in the market by creating a dynamic web
application. We will allow for organizations to create a tournament or league
or both if it is needed. As the tournament takes place the admins of the
organization will add in the results. We will have a section/page for that
game/tournament with a discussion area where you can comment if you are logged
in or as anonymous. The page will also have responsive clean data
visualization charts that update based on the stats. These features will be
built on: mySQL, node.js, angularjs.

**Phase 1:**
- Ranking
- Input match results
- User
- Organization/League

**Phase 2:**
- Brackets/Tournaments

**Phase 3:**
- Forums/Posting/Commenting

**Phase 4:**
- Chat/Private Messaging
- Mobile View

**Phase 5:**
- Betting

       
This web application will help small local organizations to have all these
tools and seem more professional and take away some of the stress of creating
and organizing a league. People will now have a place to discuss the results
of their small town soccer game. All together this will make an all in one
site where people can see results and discuss them.
